Docker Mastery Course
=====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thegiantbeast/docker-mastery-course.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thegiantbeast/docker-mastery-course)

I have started this course on Udemy and because I'm not only interested in doing the assigments and get over it, I decided to create a repository that includes all the steps that I've done in order to complete them.

This are not a copy/paste commands from elsewhere. This are handmade shell scripts tailored for each assigment specifically, also I solve the assigment before watching the next video where it shows one of the possible solutions.

## Getting started
Each assigment has its own folder and inside it's always two files:

* `README.md` - which contains the assigment requirements
* `run.sh` - where all the steps are automated to achieve those goals.
